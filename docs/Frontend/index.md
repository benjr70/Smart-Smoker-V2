# Getting Started

after installing (on the welcome page)

just run <br>
`npm run start` <br>
and <br>
visit `http://localhost:3000` <br>

will need to run the backend in order for app to function and save data <br>
so go to that page to set that up

make sure you double check the values in .env.local is pointing to your local backend (it should be by default)
