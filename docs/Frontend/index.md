# Getting Started

after installing (on the welcome page)

just run <br>
`npm run start` <br>
and <br>
visit `http://localhost:3000` <br>

will need to run the backend in order for app to function and save data <br>
so go to that page to set that up


You will need to create a .env.local for this app. The values you need for this are as follows:
* REACT_APP_CLOUD_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/
* WS_URL=http://localhost:3001
* VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=<your_generated_key>
