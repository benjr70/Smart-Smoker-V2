# Getting Started

after installing (on the welcome page)

before you start you will need to run a local mongodb server <br>
you may need to do some googling to set that up but here are the [mongoDb Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)

make sure it is running on this `http://127.0.0.1:27017` <br>
if not just update the .env.local in the backend folder

once that is set up just run <br>
`npm run start` <br>
and you should be good to go
