# Getting Started

after installing (on the welcome page)

### React App

just run <br>
`npm run start` <br>
and <br>
visit `http://localhost:8080` <br>

will need to run the backend in order for app to function and save data <br>
so go to that page to set that up

make sure you double check the values in .env.local is pointing to your local backend (it should be by default)

dimensions for the ui is build for 800 X 400


### Electron App

`npm run electron-dev` will open the electron shell in dev mode

to create an excitable to an `npm run forge:make`. This will create a `/out `folder with an excitable all all over dependents for it.

still trying to figure out how to do the docker container
